# Multi-Omic Integration Analysis 

### Uncovering Gene Regulatory Landscapes via scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq

## 📝 Overview

This repository showcases an end-to-end computational pipeline for integrating **single-cell RNA-seq** and **single-cell ATAC-seq** data to study the regulatory mechanisms of **[Insert Disease, e.g., Glioblastoma or T-cell Exhaustion]**.

As a researcher at the intersection of **Bioinformatics and AI**, I developed this project to demonstrate how deep generative models (VAEs) and graph-based inferences can bridge the gap between chromatin accessibility and gene expression.

## 🔬 Key Scientific Questions

1. **Regulatory Wiring:** How do distal enhancers regulate key pathogenic genes in [Disease Name]?
2. **Cellular Plasticity:** Can we identify transitional cell states that are invisible to single-modality analysis?
3. **TF Activity:** Which Transcription Factors (TFs) drive the lineage commitment or disease progression?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methods

### 1. Data Integration (AI-Driven)

* **Model:** Utilized **scVI-tools (MultiVI)**, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, to learn a joint latent representation of RNA and ATAC modalities.
* **Batch Correction:** Implemented neural-network-based integration to remove technical batch effects while preserving biological variance.

### 2. Chromatin & Expression Analysis

* **Linkage Inference:** Computed Peak-to-Gene correlations to identify cis-regulatory elements (cCREs).
* **GRN Reconstruction:** Built **Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN)** using **SCENIC+**, integrating motif discovery with transcriptomic co-expression.

### 3. Machine Learning Enhancement

* **Cell-type Classification:** Developed a custom classifier to cross-validate cell annotations between modalities.
* **Imputation:** Predicted missing ATAC signals from RNA profiles using latent space mapping.

## 📊 Key Results (Previews)

* **Joint Latent Space:** Successful alignment of RNA and ATAC layers showing distinct [Cell Type] clusters.
* **TF Activity Map:** Identified **[TF Name]** as a master regulator in the [Specific Pathway].
